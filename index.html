            <p>
Nablus, nestled between the majestic Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, is one of the oldest cities in the world with a history of over 4,500 years. This Palestinian gem is known for its scenic beauty, where olive trees blanket the surrounding hills. Its bustling old markets, historic mosques, and ancient buildings reflect a rich cultural tapestry. Famous for producing Nabulsi soap from pure olive oil, Nablus remains a vibrant center of tradition, education, and commerce, blending the charm of its past with the energy of the present.
